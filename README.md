# Advanced Telematics Gateway

A professional Telematics Gateway project using **STM32**, **CAN Bus**, **4G LTE**, **GPS**, **BLE**, and **Cloud Sync** for automotive applications.

---

## üõ† Project Overview

This project aims to build a complete Telematics Gateway for vehicles, capable of:

- Reading real-time vehicle data from **CAN Bus**
